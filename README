What is it?
===========

iTunesFS allows you to mount the "iTunes Music Library.xml" file as a file
system, using the excellent MacFUSE (http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/).
As of version 1.1, all local iPods will also be mounted in the similar
fashion. All playlists of either iTunes or the iPods are exposed as
directories, with their respective entries. The order of tracks within the
playlists is maintained by prefixing the tracks with their playlist index.

Please note that you have to install MacFUSE Core 0.3.0 before you can use
iTunesFS! MacFUSE Core is available at http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/.

TODO / IDEAS
============

- expose iTunesTrack metadata to Spotlight
  - would need to gather that metadata (Artist, Album, etc.) first
    (but that's trivial)
