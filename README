What is it?
===========

iTunesFS allows you to mount the "iTunes Music Library.xml" file as a file
system, using the excellent MacFUSE (http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/).
As of version 1.1, all local iPods will also be mounted in the similar
fashion. All playlists of either iTunes or the iPods are exposed as
directories, with their respective entries. The order of tracks within the
playlists is maintained by prefixing the tracks with their playlist index.

Please note that you have to install MacFUSE Core 0.3.0 before you can use
iTunesFS! MacFUSE Core is available at http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/.

As of version 1.1.3, you can also build this application using GNUstep on any
supported unix-like system (i.e. FreeBSD). Please read README-GNUstep for
further information regarding FUSE and GNUstep.

Formatters
==========

It's possible to format track names in a generic way providing format strings
either via "AlbumsTrackFormat" or "PlaylistsTrackFormat". The formatters
use a python-like syntax for formatting object properties, i.e.: %(name).
The keys in braces can be complete keypaths. Also, it's possible to provide
a number format to apply to the resulting value, i.e.: %(trackNumber#000).
Currently, track properties of interest are:
- name
- album
- artist
- extension (you can also use "ext" as a convenience)
- trackNumber
- playlistNumber

Here's an example of a more complex formatter:

"#%(trackNumber#00) %(name) (%(artist) - %(album)).%(ext)"

This would produce an output similar to this:

#05 Per Aspera Ad Astra (Moshcircus - Karma).m4a


TODO / IDEAS
============

- expose iTunesTrack metadata to Spotlight
  - would need to gather that metadata (Artist, Album, etc.) first
    (but that's trivial)
