# About the GNUstep port

This port was done using a recent (2011-01-25) svn trunk revision of
[GNUstep](http://www.gnustep.org/), utilizing gnustep-make 2.4.0.

The system used for the port is running FreeBSD 8.2-RC3,
which has a native `kqueue()` implementation.

I used the `fusefs-libs` BSD port from the ports collection,
`fusefs-libs-2.7.4`.

It's probably a good idea to include autoconf magic for figuring out all
compile time requirements, but for the time being it's just not here.

## FUSEOFS/GSFUSE

This is a fork of sdk-objc from MacFUSE which allows conditional compilation
of Mac OS X "extensions" (HFS+ and Finder related methods).
The GNUstep Makefile currently drops all MacFUSE-only functionality when the
used Foundation framework/library isn't the Apple implementation.

I'm still a bit undecided whether to base the Mac OS X version on this fork,
but at the moment this just hasn't happened and probably won't in the near
future.

## PROBLEMS

- The AppKit requirement isn't something I'm too happy with, I'd prefer to
  have a tool instead (similar to `sshfs` and the like).

- On FreeBSD 8.2rc3 I needed to grant permissions for `/dev/fuse0`:
```sh
root@fbsd8:~ # chmod o+rw /dev/fuse0
```

- On FreeBSD 10.x I need to do the following:
```sh
root@fbsd10:~ # cat << EOF >> /etc.fuse.conf
user_allow_other
EOF
root@fbsd10:~ # cat << EOF >> /etc/devfs.conf
own     fuse    root:operator
perm    fuse    0666
EOF
root@fbsd10:~ # cat << EOF >> /etc/sysctl.conf
vfs.usermount=1
EOF
root@fbsd10:~ # sysctl vfs.usermount=1
```

## EXAMPLE

There's a tiny, handcrafted (in all senses ;-) version of an iTunes Music
Library XML file in the "examples" folder. After you have built the
iTunesFS.app, use this command in a shell for starting the file system:

```sh
$ openapp ./iTunesFS.app -Library /tmp/iTunesMusicLibrary.xml \
						 -iTunesFileSystemDebugEnabled YES
```

You will then be able to browse the iTunes library, i.e.:

```sh
$ ls -l /tmp/iTunesFS/
