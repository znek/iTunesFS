	* v1.0.4

	* iTunesTrack.m: added safeguard against nameless tracks - not as
	  impossible to encounter as I'd hoped.

	* iTunesPlaylist.m: in case playlists sport track ids which have
	  disappeared from the library, skip the creation of those tracks and
	  adjust playlist index accordingly. This effect has been observed
	  with Podcasts only, yet.

	* create-itunesfs-binary-package.sh: remove 'Version' file from .dmg

	* README: updated

	* v1.0.3

	* ChangeLog: added

	* Watchdog.[hm]: added kqueue observer capable of reloading libraries
	  in case their underlying database files changed.

	* NSArray+Extensions.[hm]: added category for all things specific to
	  path handling, enhances code readability in most places.

	* iTunesFileSystem.[hm]: Added new top level hierarchy, enabling
	  more than one library to be displayed beneath the root directory.
	  The intended purpose is to also allow traversal of mounted iPods
	  in the similar fashion as is with the iTunes library.

	* iTunesLibrary.[hm]: Library exposes its name and associated icon now.
	  Also, the library uses the shared watchdog to watch its database
	  file and reload upon change.

	* iTunesTrack.[hm], iTunesPlaylist.[hm]: added copyright notice.

	* NSString+Extensions.m: removed debug log message.
