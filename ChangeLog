2012-02-19  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.3.1

	  returned in OSXFUSE 2.3.9 user libraries (which we link against and
	  hence need ppc in order to support ppc binaries).

	* v1.3.0

	* Link against OSXFUSE (http://osxfuse.github.com/) on MacOS X as of

	  are still problems (see README-GNUstep)

	* README-GNUstep: updated

2011-02-14  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* README-GNUstep: updated

	* COPYING, COPYRIGHT: it's 2011 by now

	* GNUmakefile: added main.m

	* iTunesFileSystem.m: properly implemented -needsLocalOption for
	  GNUstep

	* English.lproj/MainMenu.gorm: changed application delegate to
	  FUSEOFSAppController

	  in FUSEOFS which does everything iTunesFS requires in a more
	  abstracted manner.

	* Info.plist: added new "FUSEObjectFileSystemClass" user default
	  for FUSEOFSAppController.

2011-01-26  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* GNUmakefile: first changes for gnustep-make 2.4.0 compat

	* iTunesFSFormatter.m, iTunesPlaylist.m, iTunesTrack.m, iPodLibrary.m,
	  iTunesLibrary.m: fixed imports

	* removed outdated FUSEObjC-GNUstep subproject

	* NSString+Extensions.[hm]: moved -properlyEscapedFSRepresentation to
	  FUSEOFS/NSString+FUSEOFS.[hm]

	* iPodLibrary.m, iTunesFSFormatter.m, iTunesLibrary.m, iTunesTrack.m:
	  adjusted includes

2010-12-22  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.2.0

	* iTunesFileSystem.m: only show AlbumsTrackFormat.txt if new
	  'ShowFormatFiles' default is YES and 'UseCategories' is YES

	* iTunesFormatFile.m: ignore lines starting with '#' altogether

	* iTunesPlaylist.m: use new 'ShowFormatFiles' default

	* v1.2.0b1

	* NSObject+FUSEOFS.[hm]: changed layout and renamed every wording of
	  'directory' into 'container'.

	* iTunesFileSystem.m, iTunesLibrary.m, iTunesPlaylist.m,
	  FUSEObjectFileSystem.m, FUSEOFSFileProxy.m, FUSEOFSMemoryFile.m,
	  FUSEOFSMemoryObject.m

	* FUSEOFSMemoryFolder.[hm]: renamed to FUSEOFSMemoryContainer

	* FUSEOFSMemoryContainer.[hm]: see above

	* FUSEObjectFileSystem.m: minor fix for valueOfExtendedAttribute:...

	* iTunesFileSystem.[hm]: implemented 'AlbumsTrackFormat.txt' and
	  'PlaylistsTrackFormat.txt' for global default manipulation

	* iTunesFormatFile.m: bugfixes

	* iTunesLibrary.m: removed caching of albumsTrackFormat, which can
	  change during runtime. Some code cleanup.

	* English.lproj/AlbumsTrackFormat.txt: help text added

2010-12-21  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* FUSEObjectFileSystem.m: added workaround for a MacFUSE bug which
	  prevented deleting extended attributes - this triggers an annoying
	  warning upon startup (we're implementing a deprecated method) which
	  is totally harmless.

	* v1.1.14b5

	* English.lproj/PlaylistsTrackFormat.txt: Help text for use in
	  iTunesFormatFile, giving examples for a quick headstart

	* iTunesFormatFile.m: loads help text from a localizable file now.
	  Lazyfied setup, added support for hinting at used text encoding
	  via 'com.apple.TextEncoding' extended attribute.

	* NSObject+FUSEOFS.[hm]: added api for dealing with extended
	  attributes

	* FUSEObjectFileSystem.m: implemented extended attributes functionality
	
	* FUSEOFSMemoryObject.[hm]: new class, suiting as (new) abstract base
	  class for FUSEMemoryFile and FUSEMemoryFolder.

	* FUSEOFSMemoryFile.[hm]: code refactoring
	
	* FUSEOFSMemoryFolder.[hm]: code refactoring

2010-12-21  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.14b4

	* iTunesFormatFile.[hm]: new FUSEOFSMemoryFile subclass, implementing
	  a generic iTunesFSFormatter format string interface. Debug logging
	  can be turned on via new 'iTunesFormatFileDebugEnabled' default.

	* iTunesPlaylist.[hm]: implemented track format via new
	  iTunesFormatFile.

	* NSObject+FUSEOFS.[hm]: added -setFileAttributes: api

	* FUSEOFSMemoryFile.[hm]: renamed -setData: to -setFileContents,
	  renamed -setAttributes: to -setFileAttributes:

	* FUSEOFSMemoryFolder.[hm]: renamed -setAttributes: to
	  -setFileAttributes:, minor fixes and improvements

	* FUSEObjectFileSystem.m: massively improved debug logging,
	  improved moveItemAtPath:toPath:error: and fixed a major bug
	  in writeFileAtPath:...

2010-12-20  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.14b3

	* NSObject+FUSEOFS.m: minor cleanup

	* FUSEOFSFileProxy.m: properly implemented to transparently work for
	  files and folders

	* FUSEOFSMemoryFile.[hm]: new class which acts as a properly attributed
	  data object in memory

	* FUSEOFSMemoryFolder.[hm]: new class which acts as a properly
	  attributed folder object in memory

	* FUSEObjectFileSystem.m: added lots of debugging logs via new
	  'FUSEObjectFileSystemAccessDebugEnabled' user default. Added
	  naive implementation of -moveItemAtPath:toPath:error: (works for
	  file objects, only).

	* iTunesPlaylist.[hm]: lots of cleanup in conjunction with granting
	  write access to the playlist format file. Renamed this file from
	  '.format' to 'PlaylistTrackFormatter.txt' and made it visible, if
	  playlist isn't virtual. Implemented shadow-write cache in order to
	  enable TextEdit.app to properly edit (and autosave) this file, which
	  is probably the text editor of choice for a lot of people.

	* v1.1.14b2

	* iTunesFileSystem.m: cleanup

	* FUSEObjectFileSystem.[hm]: header cleanup, added +errorWithCode:
	  convenience method. Added MacFUSE write methods and all remaining
	  access methods (i.e. extended attributes) as skeletons. This
	  needs a lot of improvement in order to become fully functional,
	  but writing is good enough for iTunesFS, already.

	* NSObject+FUSEOFS.[hm]: added write support (see above)

	* iTunesFSFormatter.[hm]: exposed -formatString

	* iTunesPlaylist.[hm]: reworked the way tracks and corresponding
	  trackNames are being built, as these can change now during
	  playlists' life at runtime. Added -getTrackFormatString in order
	  to make this available via newly implemented write methods.
	  A playlist exposes a virtual object called '.format' for reading,
	  writing and removal. Currently, '.format' won't show up in
	  directoryContents, though this might change via a default. The
	  name isn't fixed yet, it might be better to call it differently
	  and to always show it, but that depends on more research.

2010-12-19  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* iTunesPlaylist.[hm]: added new -getTrackFormatter private method
	  which also sports formatter lookup via aliases. Also, minor
	  code cleanup and bugfixes in -generatePrettyTrackNames.

2010-12-18  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.14b1

	* iTunesFSFormatter.[hm]: added -isPathFormat and
	  -pathComponentsByFormattingObject: in order to determine if a
	  formatter describes a path and if so, get this path (optimized
	  by stripping empty path components and ready for display by
	  properly escaping it)

	* iTunesPlaylist.[hm]: changed internals to allow /both/ tracks and
	  children to co-exist in a playlist (previously, this was impossible
	  due to the way that it's impossible to mix both in iTunes).
	  Added -name to also display the persistentId if the new
	  "ShowPersistentIDs" default is set to YES.
	  Added per-playlist formatters, which require the persistentId of
	  playlists to be known. Changed -generatePrettyTrackNames to
	  detect appropriate formatters and detect whether these describe a
	  path (hierarchy). If so, a new virtual playlist hierarchy is
	  created and tracks moved these new playlists in order to reflect
	  this hierarchy.

2010-09-22  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.13

	* Released after testing confirmed everything works as expected

2010-09-15  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.13b2

	* IPhoneDiskIPodLibrary.[hm]: removed, moved contents to
	  iPodLibrary.[hm] for simplicity's sake

	* iPodLibrary.[hm]: added previous contents from
	  IPhoneDiskIPodLibrary.[hm], also added support for com.apple.afc2
	  mounted iPhones.

	* iTunesFileSystem.m: added JBiPhoneDiskIPodLibrary detection

	* v1.1.13b1

	* iPodLibrary.m: forgot to reset jump offset after decompressing the
	  library, fixed. Improved debug logs and added new
	  'iPodLibraryDebugVerbose' switch for verbose debugging.

	* iTunesFileSystem.m: work seamlessly in conjunction with iPhoneDisk
	  by faking its default mountpoint into the list of mount points to
	  check

2010-07-09  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.12

	* project.pbxproj: corrected 10.6 SDK dependency to be 10.5 instead,
	  required 10.5 minimum deployment target.

2010-03-15  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.11

	* README: removed a lot of obsolete stuff and instead redirected
	  to the project webpages

	* iPodLibrary.[hm], IPhoneDiskIPodLibrary.m, JBiPodLibrary.m:
	  corrected library lookup, which was static before - now it's
	  iTunesCDB first, then iTunesDB. Cleaned up old API, code is much
	  leaner now.

	* iTunesFileSystem.m: adjusted -needsLocalOption for 10.6

	* project.pbxproj: adjusted settings for Snow Leopard compilation.

	* MacOSX10.6.patch, MacOSX10.6-README.txt: Added patch and README
	  for proper execution on Mac OS X 10.6.

	* COPYING, COPYRIGHT: changed copyright notice for 2010

2009-08-15  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.11b3

	* iPodLibrary.m: OS X 10.6 compatible

2009-08-12  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.11b2

	* StreamReader.[hm]: simple abstraction for wrapping small parts of
	  the NSFileHandle  API either around NSFileHandle or NSData.
	  This is used when parsing iTunesDB files and will be extended
	  for parsing the decompressed NSData contents of an iTunesCDB file.

	* iPodLibrary.m: use StreamReader when parsing iTunesDB, properly
	  parse new header and discover compression. If compression is in
	  use, decompress data accordingly.

	* NSData+ZlibDecompression.m: code cleanup

	* iTunesFileSystem.m: fixed duplicate library inserts

2009-08-09  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* IPhoneDiskIPodLibrary.[hm]: new iPod/iPhone library required for
	  parsing the contents of an iPod/iPhone mounted via the
	  iphonedisk (http://code.google.com/p/iphonedisk/) FUSE filesystem.

	* NSData+ZlibDecompression.[hm]: categories for NSData to decompress
	  zlib compressed byte content, required for new iTunesCDB files.

2009-04-07  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.11b1

	* iTunesFileSystem.m: removed an obsolete and ugly hack by implementing
	  lookup properly, according to my own specs.

	* iTunesLibrary.m, iTunesTrack.m: fixed a typo in description
	  (missing trailing ">")

	* iTunesTrack.m: added a hack for the -ext method, if the file has
	  no extension return "m4a" nevertheless.

2009-01-30  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.10

	* iTunesPlaylist.[hm]: implemented playlist folders (don't recall
	  when they have been introduced in iTunes), which only contain a set
	  of other playlists. Technically, they also contain the tracks of all
	  their contained playlists, but in iTunesFS (as well as in iTunes)
	  these are ignored.

	* iTunesLibrary.m: only playlists, which are no folders, are added to
	  the top-level. Properly add playlists to their parent folders,
	  creating a nested hierarchy as in iTunes.

2009-01-29  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.9

	* iTunesLibrary.m: changed detection of libraryPath; if no default is
	  set, a candidate is looked up in the com.apple.iApps domain, first.
	  This change is based on code contributed by Frederik Seiffert
	  <frederik@algoriddim.net>.

2009-01-28  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.8

	* iTunesFileSystem.m: "allow_other" FUSE option is now triggerable via
	  a new "FUSEOptionAllowOther" default and OFF by default, as it caused
	  problems for some users.

	* README: documented new "FUSEOptionAllowOther" default

2009-01-25  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.7

	* NOTES: added Apache2/DAV config snippet

	* iTunesFileSystem.m: added "allow_other" FUSE option

	* FUSEOFS/NSObject+FUSEOFS.m: changed file permissions to be more
	  liberal (more appropriate for iTunesFS)

2009-01-11  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.7b7

	* iTunesFS.xcodeproj: pulled the plug on 10.4.x version, don't have
	  a 10.4.x box around any more and can't guarantee that the 10.4.x
	  builds will work.

	* *.[hm]: updated copyright notice for 2009, explicitly set
	  space vs. tabs and UTF-8 encoding for all code files.

	* iTunesFileSystem.m: added debug logs for (un-)mounting,
	  explicitly release libraries in -willUnmount in order to break retain
	  cycle with watchdog. Removed "ping_diskarb" from options as we no
	  longer support Tiger.

	* iTunesLibrary.m: added debug log

	* FUSEOFS/FUSEObjectFileSystem.m: fixed legacy bug in willUnmount, no
	  need to call [fs unmount]... leads to infinite recursion which
	  apparently broke unmounting.

2008-12-31  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.7b6

	* FUSEOFS/NSObject+FUSEOFS.[hm]: new experimental version of FUSEOFS
	  with slightly different object lookup (provides a context),
	  removed -isFile but added -isMutable reflection to allow write
	  methods later on

	* FUSEOFS/FUSEOFSLookupContext.[hm]: new file, represents a context
	  used during -lookupPathComponent:inContext:

	* FUSEOFS/FUSEObjectFileSystem.[hm]: -lookupPath: uses new
	  FUSEOFSLookupContext during lookup now

	* iTunesPlaylist.m: code changed due to FUSEOFS API changes

	* iTunesFileSystem.m: code changed due to FUSEOFS API changes

	* iTunesLibrary.m: code changed due to FUSEOFS API changes

	* FUSEOFS/FUSEOFSFileProxy.h: code cleanup

	* NSString+Extensions.m: major bug fixed, properly apply Unicode string
	  normalization (decomposed form) in -properlyEscapedFSRepresentation.

2008-12-29  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.7b5

	* Added filesystems-objc-support external, need NSImage+IconData for
	  displaying iconData *sigh*

	* iPodLibrary.m: fixed 64bit issues, updated iTunesDB documentation
	  reference, fixed crashbug in -close, implemented -iconData and
	  removed (old) obsolete -icon

	* iTunesLibrary.m: properly create NSData for libraryIconData (this
	  differs from previous MacFUSE versions)

	* JBiPodLibrary.m: fixed comment

	* iTunesFS.xcodeproj: link against Accelerate.framework
	  (NSImage+IconData utilizes this)

2008-12-28  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.7b4

	* iTunesFS.xcodeproj: properly enabled 64bit builds, build debug
	  build with platform arch only

	* iTunesFileSystem.m: minor cleanup and proper fuse options

2008-12-27  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.7b3

	* iTunesPlaylist.m: fixed a 64bit issue, added experimental
	  finderAttributes (disabled)

	* iTunesTrack.m: changes for new API

	* Watchdog.m: fixed several 64bit issues

	* iTunesFileSystem.m: removed AutoOpenInFinder code (moved to
	  iTunesFSController), completed conversion to new FUSE ObjC API

	* FUSEOFS/NSObject+FUSEOFS.[hm]: added -finderAttributes and
	  -resourceAttributes

	* FUSEOFS/FUSEObjectFileSystem.m: properly implemented the new
	  FUSE ObjC API

	* iTunesLibrary.[hm]: several internal changes for burn folder support

	* iTunesFSController.m: enabled registration of defaults from
	  bundle's Info.plist, observe mounting/unmounting and implemented
	  AutoOpenInFinder when mount occurred and default is set.

	* common.h: added MacFUSE/MacFUSE.h

2008-03-11  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* NOTE: THIS BUILD DOESN'T WORK, YET.
	  It's a necessary rewrite for the now official ObjC API,
	  however it's not finished (and not polished)

	* FUSEObjC: removed external dependency, as this was removed from
	  googlecode.

	* main.m: added new main() method, this will start AppKit's runloop
	  like any other AppKit based application.

	* iTunesFileSystem.m: changed to new API

	* FUSEOFS/NSObject+FUSEOFS.[hm]: changed icon API

	* FUSEOFS/FUSEObjectFileSystem.[hm]: according to new API this no
	  longer subclasses from FUSEFileSystem but is now a delegate to
	  GMUserFileSystem. There is quite a lot to be done still and several
	  places need to be revisited.
	  
	* English.lproj/MainMenu.nib: changed to new object model

	* iTunesLibrary.[hm]: changed icon API, see FUSEOFS/NSObject+FUSEOFS

	* JBiPodLibrary.m: added a comment, need to address this

	* iTunesFSController.[hm]: new application delegate, needs work (i.e.
	  defaults need to be fetched dynamically, FS initializer is pretty
	  ugly)

	* common.h: we need Appkit now

2008-01-09  Dan Villiom Podlaski Christiansen  <dan@villiom.dk>

	* README: updated for new defaults 'AutoOpenInFinder' and
	  'UseBurnFoldersInFinder'

	* FUSEOFS/FUSEObjectFileSystem.m: properly set the volicon fuse option
	  if we have a custom icon for the filesystem

	* iTunesLibrary.h: expose burn folder helper methods to subclassers

	* iTunesLibrary.m, iPodLibrary.m: properly set burn folder names if the
	  default is set to YES

	* iTunesFS.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj: removed redundant variables,
	  use standard way to choose C99

	* Info.plist: set the default value (YES) for new 'AutoOpenInFinder'
	  user default

2008-01-07  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* iPodLibrary.m: forgot to set "Track Number" properly, reported by
	  Tim Fitzgerald

	* *.*: updated copyright information for 2008

2007-12-31  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.6

	* README: updated, added proper MacFUSE Core versions

	* iTunesFileSystem.m: added "NoITunes" default, preventing iTunes
	  library from being displayed (feature request by Iacopo Cacciaguerra)

2007-12-27  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* README: updated, added .fseventsd TODO

	* FUSEObjectFileSystem.m: renamed all overridden methods due to upgrade
	  of FUSEObjC

	* iTunesFileSystem.m: implemented -fuseOptions, renamed -isLocal to
	  - needsLocalOption

2007-11-22  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* iTunesFileSystem.m: implement -isLocal to return YES on
	  Mac OS X 10.5.x due to Leopard's Finder's broken behavior in dealing
	  with FUSE filesystems

	* iTunesFS.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj: promoted to Xcode 3.0 project

2007-10-30  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.5

	* iPodLibrary.h: expose -mountPoint (for subclassers).

	* iPodLibrary.m: added safeguards in -setLocation: in case content in
	  iTunesDB file is malformed (or in a new scheme we don't understand,
	  yet).

	* JBiPodLibrary.[hm]: new subclass of iPodLibrary which sports the
	  new folder locations of iPod Touch and iPhone.

	* iTunesFileSystem.m: added JBiPodLibrary support. Add additional
	  entries to volume paths of removable devices from new
	  "iPodMountPoints" user default.

2007-08-01  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* iTunesLibrary.m: added "Compilations" patch from Mark Wallis which
	  aggregates all albums which have different artists in this folder

	* {*}.lproj/Localizable.strings: added "Compilations"

	* AUTHORS: updated

	* NOTES: updated

	* English.lproj/MainMenu.nib: updated, but still invisible - we
	  probably could use a UI for setting formatters and the like, but
	  I'm still a bit undecided.

	* {Italian,Spanish}.lproj/Localizable.strings: fixed Italian and
	  Spanish localizations.

2007-07-02  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.4

	* README: updated defaults section and added "Formatters" section

	* iTunesFSFormatter.[hm]: new formatter object - this is used
	  for formatting all track names for now. Includes ability to provide
	  format strings for number formatters.

	* iTunesTrack.[hm]: deprecated -prettyName, use -name now. Added
	  -extension (and, as a convenience, -ext), -trackNumber and
	  -playlistNumber for formatting purposes. Removed the
	  "DetailedTrackNames" default.

	* iTunesLibrary.m: added new "AlbumsTrackFormat" default for formatting
	  track names in "Albums" and "Songs".

	* iTunesPlaylist.m: added new "PlaylistsTrackFormat" default for
	  formatting track names in "Playlists".

	* FUSEOFS/*: added new FUSEOFS subproject. The idea here is to have
	  a reusable object model for other FUSEObjC based file systems.

	* iTunesFileSystem.[hm]: moved all lookup related stuff to new
	  superclass, FUSEObjectFileSystem.

	* iTunesLibrary.m, iPodLibrary.m, iTunesPlaylist.m, iTunesTrack.m:
	  changed all references of "iTunesFS" to "FUSEOFS".

	* NSArray+Extensions.[hm]: removed obsolete category

	* NSObject+Extensions.[hm]: removed, part of FUSEOFS now.

	* GNUmakefile{,.preamble}: added FUSEOFS

2007-06-14  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.3

	* README: updated with GNUstep info and new NSUserDefaults description

	* README-GNUstep: added

	* NOTES: added localization hint

	* Info.plist: added all NSUserDefaults

	* iTunesLibrary.[hm]: added new -reloadVirtualMaps public API used
	  by subclassers to call after -reload is done

	* iTunesLibrary.m: if "UseCategories" default is YES, display
	  "Playlists", "Artists" and "Albums" as virtual folders

	* iPodLibrary.m: call -reloadVirtualMaps after -reload, properly
	  parse "Albums" and "Artists" for tracks

	* iTunesTrack.[hm]: remember "Artist" and "Album" for later use

	* NSString+Extensions.m: removed obsolete category methods. Properly
	  escape ":" (0x35) with similar glyph (0xFF1A)

	* {English,German,French,Italian,Spanish,Japanese}.lproj/
	  Localizable.strings: added localized variants of the virtual category
	  folder names

	* English.lproj/MainMenu.gorm: added main interface for GNUstep

	* FUSEObjC-GNUstep/*: added port of FUSEObjC specifically for GNUstep,
	  basically removed all HFS+ and Finder related stuff

	* examples/iTunesMusicLibrary.xml: added new tiny library for users
	  who don't have iTunes around but want to take a look nevertheless

2007-06-08  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* iTunesFileSystem.m: fixed typo in -description

	* iTunesLibrary.m: only append iTunes library version number to name if
	  debugging is enabled.

	* Resources/*: moved everything in here to top-level directory

2007-05-31  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.2

	* iTunesFileSystem.m: inform NSWorkspace about directory changes
	  (doesn't seem to have the desired effect on my system, though).
	  Implemented symbolic link lookup.

	* NSURL+Extensions.[hm]: new category for properly demangling
	  "?" characters in file URLs to "_", as this is what iTunes seems to
	  do

	* NSObject+Extensions.[hm]: added new method -symbolicLinkTarget

	* iTunesLibrary.m: if library contains only one playlist (i.e. Shuffle)
	  skip the playlist in listing and instead show all tracks.

	* iPodLibrary.m: extract "dateModified" and "dateAdded" from iTunesDB
	  and put it into representation dictionary for iTunesTrack to
	  initialize with

	* iTunesTrack.[hm]: Derive FileSystemAttributes from attributes stored
	  in either iTunes or iTunesDB representation. Properly demangle
	  file URL paths before accessing data in hose file system. Return
	  these URL paths as symbolic link targets when asked to. Return
	  NSFileType == NSFileTypeSymbolicLink in case the "SymbolicLinks"
	  user default is true.

	* iTunesFileSystem.m, iTunesLibrary.m, iTunesPlaylist.m, iTunesTrack.m:
	  added custom -description to aid in debugging

2007-05-29  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.1

	* NOTES: added some Spotlight info

	* README: updated

	* NSObject+Extensions.[hm]: new iTunesFS lookup methods which
	  dramatically simplify the implementation

	* iTunesFileSystem.m: added new "iTunesFileSystemDebugEnabled" and
	  "NoIPods" defaults (described in README). Added some debug output,
	  when iTunesFileSystemDebugEnabled == YES. All paths will be mangled
	  now before they are being processed - using the "NoIPods" default
	  this leads to the whole "libraries" hierarchy to be hidden, as it's
	  not useful to display it then.
	  Implemented new lookup algorithm for looking up "generic" objects
	  for performing all file system related operations on. Call -close
	  on libraries whose mount points are about to vanish.

	* iTunesTrack.[hm]: minor renaming, implemented file system operations
	  as part of the new lookup API

	* iTunesPlaylist.m: implemented lookup API

	* iTunesLibrary.[hm]: removed quite a bit of the old API, implemented
	  new lookup API. Added new -close method which can be called in
	  case a file system will be unmounted.

2007-05-24  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.1.0

	* iTunesTrack.[hm]: remove name (including playlist index) from
	  track, instead provide just the prettyName stub. Directly access
	  NSUserDefaults for finding out about whether detailed track names
	  are requested - and subsequently removed the public API for setting
	  that. Added initializer for iPodLibrary representation, renamed the
	  old initializer to better reflect what's happening.

	* iTunesPlaylist.[hm]: store the trackNames locally, including the
	  proper playlist index. Changed API to initialize using the
	  respective library. Use this library now to retrieve tracks via
	  their ID. Added initializers similar to iTunesTrack.

	* iTunesLibrary.[hm]: create a cache for tracks which works
	  universally in all playlists. Doing so reduces memory footprint
	  significantly. Changed API to allow access to cached tracks via
	  their ID. Added API for -mountPoint, which is required for the
	  iPodLibrary subclass.

	* iPodLibrary.[hm]: New subclass of iTunesLibrary, representing the
	  iTunesDB which is found on iPods.

	* iTunesFileSystem.[hm]: Added API for removing libraries. The
	  iTunesFileSystem registers itself for distributed workspace
	  notifications regarding the mounting/unmounting of removable
	  devices. If such a device is found and in fact is an iPod, its
	  library will be exposed in a fashion similar to that of the
	  iTunes Library.

	* NSString+Extensions.[hm]: added new method for dealing with
	  initializing NSStrings with little endian unicode representations.

2007-05-23  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.0.4

	* iTunesTrack.m: added safeguard against nameless tracks - not as
	  impossible to encounter as I'd hoped.

	* iTunesPlaylist.m: in case playlists sport track ids which have
	  disappeared from the library, skip the creation of those tracks and
	  adjust playlist index accordingly. This effect has been observed
	  with Podcasts only, yet.

	* create-itunesfs-binary-package.sh: remove 'Version' file from .dmg

	* README: updated

	* v1.0.3

	* ChangeLog: added

	* Watchdog.[hm]: added kqueue observer capable of reloading libraries
	  in case their underlying database files changed.

	* NSArray+Extensions.[hm]: added category for all things specific to
	  path handling, enhances code readability in most places.

	* iTunesFileSystem.[hm]: Added new top level hierarchy, enabling
	  more than one library to be displayed beneath the root directory.
	  The intended purpose is to also allow traversal of mounted iPods
	  in the similar fashion as is with the iTunes library.

	* iTunesLibrary.[hm]: Library exposes its name and associated icon now.
	  Also, the library uses the shared watchdog to watch its database
	  file and reload upon change.

	* iTunesTrack.[hm], iTunesPlaylist.[hm]: added copyright notice.

	* NSString+Extensions.m: removed debug log message.
