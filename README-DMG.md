What is iTunesFS?
=================

iTunesFS allows you to mount your local iTunes library and locally mounted
iPods/iPhones as a *single file system mount point*, exposing all the details
like artists, albums and playlists as separate directories with their
respective entries. The naming of tracks and playlists within these directories
is highly configurable.

Before you launch the application!
----------------------------------

Note that ==you have to install
[macFUSE](https://osxfuse.github.io/)== before you can use iTunesFS!
